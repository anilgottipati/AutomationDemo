JDK-->Java Developer Kit
Convert Source code to Byte Code

Program To Run Needs an Environment
JRE-->Java RunTime Environment Provides that Environment for Byte code to Run

API-->Application Program Interface
Provides Predefined without write lowlevel Back Ground Code
Example:
Reading and Writing Files
Java IO Library

Platform Independent Language:
In language like C and C++ If source code is compiled on Particular Operating System
like Windows it generates a Machine Code that only understand by the Windows OS and not by MAC
or Linux vice Versa called Platform Dependency.

In Java when we compiled the code, the Java Compiler generates the Intermediate code called
Byte code, this is not Machine code for Particular Operating System.This byte code can be interpreted
by Windows JVM JIT to underlined OS Windows and Windows JVM JIT to underlined Linux OS

Oops:
Map Real World Problems to Software Solutions

Encapsulation:
It will Protect the properties and Functionalities of an object from other object

Example: Like Capsule it have all Properties and Data of a Particular Object and we have all
Methods that access particular Object

Here Capsule is called a Class and Data we call it as Properties\Variables and Functionalities\Methods
can access that data.
If other objects need to access this data if we follow proper encapsulation then they always
need to go through these Methods\Functionalities to access the Properties\variables of that Object.

So Writing the Data and Code in one Single Unit, so in Java we use a Class to achieve the
encapsulation
Class
{
Data
Code
}
